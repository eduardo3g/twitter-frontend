# 📚 Introduction

This front-end application is an identical Twitter clone. It was made to connect to a fully Serverless back-end application, which is opened at <a ref="https://github.com/eduardo3g/twitter">this repository</a>. I recommend you check it out if you want to build production-ready Serverless applications with Amazon Web Services.
